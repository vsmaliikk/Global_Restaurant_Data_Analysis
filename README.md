# Global_Restaurant_Data_Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing global restaurant data to uncover key insights. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis by removing errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies, and then extracting meaningful information through various analyses and visualizations.

## Tasks List

- Explored the top three most common cuisines in the dataset.
- Determined the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.

### Task 2: City Analysis 🌍
- Identified the city with the highest number of restaurants in the dataset.
- Calculated the average rating for restaurants in each city.
- Found the city with the highest average rating.

### Task 3: Price Range Distribution 💵
- Created a bar chart to analyze and visualize the distribution of price ranges among the restaurants.
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range.

### Task 4: Online Delivery Analysis 🏃
- Determined the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery.
- Analyzed the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

### Task 5: Restaurant Ratings ⭐
- Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings and determined the most common rating range.
- Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

### Task 6: Cuisine Combination 🍽️
- Identified the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset.
- Determined if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

### Task 7: Geographic Analysis 🌐
- Plotted the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Identified patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.
